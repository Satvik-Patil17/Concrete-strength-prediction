# Concrete-strength-prediction
This repository contains a data-driven project that predicts the compressive strength of concrete using a machine learning model.  By analyzing the relationship between these factors and the resulting strength, the project provides insights and predictions that can aid in optimizing concrete mixes.

Project Overview
Concrete is a critical component in construction, and its compressive strength is one of its most important properties. This project aims to:

Build a predictive model for concrete strength based on material composition and curing age.
Identify the key factors influencing concrete strength.
Provide a streamlined workflow for analyzing concrete performance in various scenarios.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

Cement: Amount of cement in the mix.
Slag: Quantity of slag used.
Ash: Quantity of fly ash.
Water: Water content in the mix.
Superplasticizer: Amount of superplasticizer added.
Coarse Aggregate: Amount of coarse aggregate.
Fine Aggregate: Amount of fine aggregate.
Age: Age of concrete (in days) at the time of strength testing.
Strength: Compressive strength of the concrete (target variable).


Key Features of the Project
